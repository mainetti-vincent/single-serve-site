  <h2>About</h2>
    <figure class="Headshot">
    <img class="about" src="img/photo.png">
    </figure>
  <p>At a young age, I discovered a strong interest in papers, pencils and pens. This interest quickly developed into a love for the arts. I spent most of my young life drawing as much as I could, and learned that art provided me a level of enjoyment I couldn’t find elsewhere. As I grew older my interests migrated towards technology, and I found myself spending time navigating this new online world. Eventually I found myself with an Associate’s degree in art studies, it was at that point that I realized that I wanted to do more than just study the arts. I wanted to create using the technology that enticed me as a child. Graphic design was the perfect combination of the arts and technology, and in 2015 I began my journey towards becoming a designer. I enrolled at my local community college with the goal of a second Associate’s degree. I graduated in 2017 with several academic awards, and am now pursuing a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts at Montserrat College of Art. </p>

    <h3>Type Specimen Booklet</h3>
      <figure class="large-photo">
      <img class="gif" src="img/type-specimen/booklet.gif">
    </figure>
      <p class="about">The “Type Specimen” assignment required students to create a booklet 4.2”x7” with specific interior margins set at 2p0 for the outside and top, 3p0 for the inside, and 5p0 for the bottom. A total of six typefaces, each of a different style of type, the second requirement. Each typeface would have three pages in total, the first showcasing the characters within the typeface, the second showing a minimum of two paragraphs in justified format, and the third showing those same paragraphs in a ‘rag’ right format. The type being shown on both pages of paragraphs was to be set at the same point size. This booklet was required to also contain a cover/back–cover, title page, and table of contents.

    <h3>Poetry Booklet</h3>
    <figure class="large-photo">
      <img class="gif" src="img/poetry-booklet/poetry-booklet350px.gif">
    </figure>
      <p>The ‘Poetry Booklet’ assignment provided an article titled “Lingodroids: Studies in Spatial Cognition and Language,” and required that I compose six different and unique poems about the article while only using words found within the article. The poems were then to be set, in a booklet without size requirements, in a non-conventional manner. The goal being that the typography would influence, and hopefully enhance the reading of, and meaning of the poems. The booklet was required to contain a cover/back–cover, title page, and table of contents. </p>

      <p>The Architecture and Alphabet assignment required that I choose any architect considered modern, and create either a poster, or booklet showcasing the architects work. If the choice was a poster then it could be as simple as an event relating to one of that architects building, but if it was a booklet then it should incorporate more information. The designs of the poster or booklet should relate directly to that architects own unique style in a way that also shows how the alphabet is incorporated into architectural forms. </p>

      <p>As a class we were instructed to choose a book that we have recently read. Preferably one that did not contain images. After we chose a book we were then asked to design three different book covers for that specific book, while relating the covers to the narrative. These were my solutions</p>

      <p>I was given the choice between 5 different businesses that were already in existence but had branding that was not up to date with 2017. I was asked to do a re-design of the businesses logo. After that was taken care of I was asked to create two different levels of letterheads. After that I was asked to create a standards manual explaining how to properly use the new logo in multiple different forms of branding</p>
