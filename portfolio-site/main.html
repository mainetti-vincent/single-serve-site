  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>At a young age, I discovered a strong interest in papers, pencils and pens. This interest quickly developed into a love for the arts. I spent most of my young life drawing as much as I could, and learned that art provided me a level of enjoyment I couldn’t find elsewhere. As I grew older my interests migrated towards technology, and I found myself spending time navigating this new online world. Eventually I found myself with an Associate’s degree in art studies, it was at that point that I realized that I wanted to do more than just study the arts. I wanted to create using the technology that enticed me as a child. Graphic design was the perfect combination of the arts and technology, and in 2015 I began my journey towards becoming a designer. I enrolled at my local community college with the goal of a second Associate’s degree. I graduated in 2017 with several academic awards, and am now pursuing a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts at Montserrat College of Art. This website is both a store front and a portfolio. Contact me with any questions or comments, and please enjoy my work.</p>

    <h3>Type Specimen Booklet</h3>
      <figure class="large-photo">
      <img class="gif" src="img/type-specimen/booklet.gif">
    </figure>
      <p class="about">The “Type Specimen” assignment required students to create a booklet 4.2”x7” with specific interior margins set at 2p0 for the outside and top, 3p0 for the inside, and 5p0 for the bottom. A total of six typefaces, each of a different style of type, the second requirement. Each typeface would have three pages in total, the first showcasing the characters within the typeface, the second showing a minimum of two paragraphs in justified format, and the third showing those same paragraphs in a ‘rag’ right format. The type being shown on both pages of paragraphs was to be set at the same point size. This booklet was required to also contain a cover/back–cover, title page, and table of contents.

      <p>This assignment helped me to understand how the gird is important to creating a multi page document, and unifying the design. It also helped me to understand how to properly display text effectively across multiple pages. Finally this assignment taught me what it take to create a small booklet. </p>
    <h3>Poetry Booklet</h3>
    <figure class="large-photo">
      <img class="gif" src="img/poetry-booklet/poetry-booklet350px.gif">
    </figure>
      <p>The ‘Poetry Booklet’ assignment provided an article titled “Lingodroids: Studies in Spatial Cognition and Language,” and required that I compose six different and unique poems about the article while only using words found within the article. The poems were then to be set, in a booklet without size requirements, in a non-conventional manner. The goal being that the typography would influence, and hopefully enhance the reading of, and meaning of the poems. The booklet was required to contain a cover/back–cover, title page, and table of contents. </p>

      <p>This assignment helped me to think of type in a more abstract way, by forcing me to write poems not only with words, but by using those words in creative way to reinforce the feeling of the poem. /p>
      
    <h3>Architecture Booklet</h3>

    "></a>
    </figure>
      <p>The Architecture and Alphabet assignment required that I choose any architect considered modern, and create either a poster, or booklet showcasing the architects work. If the choice was a poster then it could be as simple as an event relating to one of that architects building, but if it was a booklet then it should incorporate more information. The designs of the poster or booklet should relate directly to that architects own unique style in a way that also shows how the alphabet is incorporated into architectural forms. </p>
